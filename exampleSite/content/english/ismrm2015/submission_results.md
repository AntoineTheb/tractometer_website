### Link to all the raw submission files

All submissions files are downloadable through <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.840086">Zenodo. <img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.840086.svg" alt="DOI"> </a>. This is the link to the raw submitted files, in their original format. Format and headers of some files were modified prior to usage, in an effort to compensate for the lack of clarity in format managements in 2015. For more information, contact us.


### Maier-Hein 2017: Results using Recobundles for segmentation

These are the results as presented in Maier-Hein2017 (scoring based on segmentation with **Recobundles**). 

**Please be careful!** Wrong numbers have sometimes been published in articles citing the ISMRM Challenge. Numbers previously contained on this page also presented errors. Always refer to this new table, updated as of 2022. They are in accordance with data published in 2017.

### Renauld 2023: Results using the ROI segmentation

These results were computed with 1) curated data (cleaner bundles, see <a href="/ismrm2015/phantom_creation"> here </a> for more explanation) and 2) segmentation of the submitted tractograms with ROIs rather than Recobundles. These results should be compared with previous versions with care as data now contains 21 bundles instead of 25. These results should be published soon in an upcoming paper.
