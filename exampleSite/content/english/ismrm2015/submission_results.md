### 2015: Results using Recobundles for segmentation


These are the results as presented in the original paper (initial data, scoring based on segmentation with **Recobundles**). 

**Please be careful!** Wrong numbers have sometimes been published in papers citing the ISMRM Challenge paper. Also, numbers previously contained on this page also presented errors. Always refer to this new table. They are in accordance with data published in the 2015 paper.

### 2022: Results using the ROI segmentation

These results were computed with 1) curated data (cleaner bundles, see <a href="/results_ismrm/phantom_creation"> here </a> for more explanation) and 2) segmentation of the submitted tractograms with ROIs rather than Recobundles. These results should be compared with previous versions with care as data now contains 21 bundles instead of 25. These results should be published soon in an upcoming paper.
