In order to allow people to reproduce results and score new tractograms, the Challenge team has made a standalone version of the scoring script available to anyone who might be interested.

Please note that version <i>v1.0.1</i> is exactly the same as what was used to generate the scores presented on this website and in the paper. Any remaining issue was already present at the time.

This version is also accessible using <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.810130"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.810130.svg" alt="DOI"></a>.

The scoring tool and its documentation are available in this <a href="https://github.com/scilus/ismrm_2015_tractography_challenge_scoring"> Github repository </a> of the <a href="http://scil.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/">SCIL</a>.

In addition to the code, this <a href="/data/ismrm2015/scoring_data_tractography_challenge.tar.gz"> data archive</a> is needed to score a new tractogram.
