### 2022 Update paper

An update paper should soon be published, including the suggested cleaning of the ground truth bundle, and the suggested new scoring based on ROI segmentation. Meanwhile, if you use this information, please cite this accepted abstract to the ISMRM 2022 Diffusion Workshop:

The last hour of the <i>Diffusion Study Group</i> of the ISMRM 2015 was dedicated to a discussion and debate on the open questions of tractography. Some of the main insights that were presented included:

- Generating streamlines that are perfectly voxel-aligned to the ground-truth anatomy is really challenging, in part because of the artefacts correction process. These corrections almost always add some shift with respect to the underlying anatomy. 
- The previous point can have a huge impact in a pipeline that registers multiple subjects to a common template, for example for group studies.
- Scores are much better and more realistic when using a bundle recognition technique, instead of the classical Tractometer technique, which is based on endpoints.
-  Most teams found 23 of 25 Valid Bundles, at the cost of generating multiple Invalid Bundles. 
- Only one submission found the 25 Valid Bundles.
- The most difficult bundles were the Anterior Commissure and the Posterior Commissure.
- The main differences between pipelines are seen in the Invalid connections and the "No connections" (streamlines not connecting 2 regions). 
- There needs to be a unified tractography format, to avoid potential interaction and interpretation problems.
